In a world where most mods let you specialize with classes, The Gilded Ones is a mod that adds another layer
to that. Earth, air, water, fire. Have you ever thought that mage had some cool mechanics but ranger had
better damage? Well, become an earth ranger and you'll soon have homing attacks and rain boulders from
the sky! You can be any class and any element you want at the same time, there's no "Earth is better for 
mage and Water is better for ranger" They are both equal, yet unique in their own ways.
